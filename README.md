# Aim:
To perform the Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Audio Generation

# Algorithm: 
Explore how various prompting techniques can be used to generate and manipulate audio content (e.g., music, sound effects, voice narration) using AI model
1 Define Prompt Categories

Genre-based

Instrument-based

Emotion-driven

Scene/environmental

Voice/dialogue (speech synthesis)

Style/tone-based

Multimodal (e.g., text + image)

2 Design Prompt Variants

Create 2‚Äì3 prompt examples per category

Ensure prompts vary in detail (basic ‚Üí rich)

3 Feed Prompts to Audio Generation Model

Use AI tools like AudioCraft, MusicLM, Bark, etc.

Pass prompts through model APIs or interfaces

4 Collect Audio Outputs

Store each generated audio file

Label with prompt type, description, and metadata

5 Analyze Outputs

Assess output quality: tone, accuracy, emotion, clarity

Compare how changes in prompt phrasing affect results

6 Evaluate Prompt Effectiveness

Match between prompt intent and audio result

Note any limitations or strengths in model behavior

7 Summarize Findings

Identify which prompt styles yield best control

Recommend optimal prompt formats per audio type

## Procedure:

## üîπ Stage 1: Basic Audio Prompt
Goal: Request simple audio generation with a one-line description.

Prompt Example:

‚ÄúGenerate a relaxing ambient sound.‚Äù

Expected Output (from an audio model like AudioCraft):

30-second ambient loop with soft pads, wind noises, and light textures.

üéß Audio Type: Background music for meditation or relaxation.

## üîπ Stage 2: Structured Prompting
Goal: Add musical structure, genre, instruments.

Prompt Example:

‚ÄúGenerate a 1-minute lo-fi hip-hop beat with vinyl crackle, soft piano chords, and a slow tempo.‚Äù

Expected Output:

Track with soft lo-fi drums

Warm vinyl background noise

Repetitive mellow piano loop at ~70 BPM

üéß Audio Type: Lo-fi study background track

## üîπ Stage 3: Contextual & Emotion-Based Prompting
Goal: Guide the model using emotion, scene, or story.

Prompt Example:

‚ÄúCreate cinematic background music for a hero walking through a destroyed city at sunrise ‚Äî hopeful but somber tone.‚Äù

Expected Output:

Slow orchestral swell

Minor key evolving to major

Strings, distant horns, ambient soundscape

üéß Audio Type: Emotional movie soundtrack

## üîπ Stage 4: Multimodal Prompting (Advanced Models)
Goal: Combine text + image/video/audio for richer audio generation (e.g., from a silent video or image prompt).

Prompt Example:

Text: ‚ÄúRainy street at night‚Äù
Image: Uploaded cityscape with wet pavement and neon lights
Audio Prompt Model interprets scene and generates...

Expected Output:

Sound of rain, distant traffic, soft jazz saxophone

Echoey, urban ambient layer

üéß Audio Type: Scene-based soundscape

## üîπ Stage 5: Dialogue & Speech (Voice Models like Bark or TTS)
Goal: Generate expressive voice audio from prompt with style, age, tone.

Prompt Example:

‚ÄúNarrate this like a wise old storyteller with a warm, deep voice: ‚ÄòLong ago, in a forest untouched by time‚Ä¶‚Äô‚Äù

Expected Output:

Speech audio with a warm, slightly gravelly tone

Pacing and intonation appropriate for storytelling

üé§ Audio Type: Voice narration (TTS with style control)


# Step 1: Define Prompt Categories
prompt_types = [
    "Genre-based",
    "Instrument-based",
    "Emotion-based",
    "Scene/environment-based",
    "Dialogue/speech-based",
    "Multimodal (image + text)",
    "Style/tone-based"
]

# Step 2: Create Prompt Variants for Each Category
def generate_prompt_variants():
    prompts = {
        "Genre-based": [
            "Generate a classical piano piece.",
            "Create an upbeat EDM track with synths."
        ],
        "Instrument-based": [
            "Solo guitar playing a blues riff.",
            "Drums and bass in a funk rhythm."
        ],
        "Emotion-based": [
            "Music that feels nostalgic and sad.",
            "Uplifting motivational music for a workout."
        ],
        "Scene/environment-based": [
            "Background sounds of a jungle at dawn.",
            "Rainstorm in a city with distant thunder."
        ],
        "Dialogue/speech-based": [
            "Narrate this line in a robotic voice: 'System activated.'",
            "Speak this with emotion: 'I never thought I‚Äôd see this day‚Ä¶'"
        ],
        "Multimodal (image + text)": [
            {"image": "mountain_sunset.jpg", "text": "Create peaceful music for this view."}
        ],
        "Style/tone-based": [
            "Generate music with an 80s synth-pop vibe.",
            "Voice saying 'Welcome' in a formal tone."
        ]
    }
    return prompts

# Step 3: Send Prompts to Audio Generation Model
def send_to_model(prompt):
    # Placeholder for API call to models like AudioCraft, Bark, or MusicLM
    audio_output = generate_audio(prompt)  # This would be your AI model call
    return audio_output

# Step 4: Analyze and Compare Outputs
def analyze_outputs(prompts_by_type):
    results = {}
    for category, prompt_list in prompts_by_type.items():
        results[category] = []
        for prompt in prompt_list:
            audio = send_to_model(prompt)
            # Store audio and metadata for evaluation
            results[category].append({
                "prompt": prompt,
                "audio_output": audio,
                "notes": evaluate_audio(audio)  # Placeholder for manual or automated analysis
            })
    return results

# Step 5: Evaluate Audio Outputs (manually or with ML tools)
def evaluate_audio(audio_file):
    # Could be subjective (human feedback) or objective (BPM, mood classifier, etc.)
    return {
        "duration": "30s",
        "mood": "calm",
        "clarity": "high",
        "matches_prompt": True  # Based on prompt-to-output alignment
    }

# Step 6: Summarize Findings
def summarize_findings(results):
    for category, outputs in results.items():
        print(f"\n## {category} Prompts")
        for item in outputs:
            print(f"Prompt: {item['prompt']}")
            print(f"‚Üí Audio Info: {item['notes']}")
            print("---")
